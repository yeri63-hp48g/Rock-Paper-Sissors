Here's a favorite game, played with nothing more than two friends using simple hand gesters, representing the objects of the game in the title. What is so fantastic about the game is its simplicity, and the lack materials needed to play. I've seen it played on road trips, summer camp, and on the playground. The challenge was always trying to predict what your opponent was going to use, to block or win that game.
